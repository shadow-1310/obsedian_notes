#### Types
- Decision
- Optimization
- Enumeration

### Implementation from scratch
#### pseudo-code
#### code
## Not to do
---
- never put list.append() as an argument inside function call. Otherwise [[77-Combinations#^d6d060|this case ]]will occur
- don't append in curr list in res when reaching base condition instead append a copy
