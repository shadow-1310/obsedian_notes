## Non comparison based
---
### Counting sort
- best algorithm when range is given- linear time
	- problem is if max number very high space required will be high
- constraint is , following should be given 
	- input size, N
	- range, K
- time complexity
	- O(N+K)
- Space complexity
	- O(k)
### Radix Sort
- non comparative algorithm


### Bucket Sort
- constraints
	- floating point
	- range is [0,1]
