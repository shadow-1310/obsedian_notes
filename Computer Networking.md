- connection less - no need to establish prior connection
- datagram service - packets can travels from any route
- classfull addressing [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iurle2xZrBQ&list=PLxCzCOWd7aiGFBD2-2joCpWOLUrDLvVV_&index=42)
	- class A,B, C, D, E
	- 32 bit, dotted decimal
	- class A - 1st bit is 0 in prefix 
		- total 2^31 addresses
		- total 2^7 (= 128) networks
			- first and last are not given to any org
			- i.e used networks are 128-2=126
		- total 2^24 hosts per network
			- 2 addresses are not given
			- firs ip is used to recognize the network
			- last IP is used for broadcast
			- available hosts = 2^24-2
		- first octet is for network
		- rest 24 bits are for host
		- Default mask is used to identify the network
			- for class A it is, 255.0.0.0
	- Class C - range: 192-223 
		- IP address possible - 2^29
		- first 3 octet are for networks, last  octet is for hosts
			- but first 3 bit are for class C (110)
			- 24-3=21 , networks possible - 2^21
- Given
	- IP address: 201.20.30.40
	- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
- find 
	- network address: 201.20.30.0 (performed bitwise & operation)
	- 4th host id : 201.20.30.4
	- last host id:201.20.30.254
	- broadcast addresss
		- limited - 255.255.255.255 (all 1's)
		- direct - 201.20.30.255 (last ip address )
- Hostname + DNS Domain =  domain name
- FQDN - Fully Qualified Domain Name
	- labels are connected by dot(.)
	- each labels must be 1-63 characters long
	- a-z0-9 and '-'
	- special characters are  not allowed
	- en.wikipedia.org
		- en - hostname
		- wikipedia.org - domain name
		- en.wikipedia.ord - FQDN
	- FQDN <-> IP address 
		- by DNS/hosts file 
- DNS 
	- ip addresses are tough to remember
	- ip address are dynamic
	- Resolver ->Root server -> generic server -> authoritative server
