## Project
---
- Objectives
	- if a named entity recently appears on news, we check
		- whether there exist a wiki page for it, if not we will suggest for its creation
		- when this page was first created and compare it with first news of that named entity
			- if wiki page was created after this named entity's first news, we'll suggest to add the missing information



## Assignment 2 (Data Discovery and exploration)
### definitions
- data discovery - process of identifying datasets that may meet an information need
- data exploration - process of understanding properties of candidate datasets and relations among them.

## Aim
- addressing the requirement to identify several, potentially interrelated datasets within huge repositories, where the datasets within the repositories were likely produced independently of each other.
#### Points 
- According to survey 19% of data scientist's time is spent on discovering and selecting suitable dataset
- to support data scientist and data engineers in management of data repositories numerous metadata model has been proposed
- However, in a setting where there may be millions of datasets, and where these datasets may change rapidly [39], it is impractical to manually curate data catalogs with rich descriptions of all the available data and it can still be challenging to understand what data is available to support a specific task.
- support search over datasets that have been minimally annotated, automate annotation of datasets with terms from ontologies,

## Focus areas
#### Dataset search
- Given a repository of data, a search aims to retrieve datasets that, individually or together, satisfy an information need. Thus, given a collection of datasets C and a search request R,
- Search(C,R) -->  S
#### Dataset Navigation
- Having identified a dataset, for example, as a result of a search process, it is often useful to be able to explore related datasets that may provide additional information or context.
- Thus, given a dataset d (a 1 , . . . , an ) and a collection of datasets C, there there may be an operation of the form
- $RealtedAttribute(d.a_i,C)\rightarrow S$

#### Data Annotation
- In a large repository, there are likely to be a variety of naming conventions, for example, because the data was originally produced by different publishers. nuisance, as it places the burden on the user of resolving inconsistencies as part of the process of selecting data for analysis.
- Data annotation is the process of associating intensional or extensional data items with a term from a vocabulary or a concept from an ontology.

#### Schema Inference
- Data integration can be associated with the notion of a global schemaâ€”a schema that an end user interacts with, and behind which the heterogeneity of different sources is hidden
