### Remember
- two -ve sentence can't give any conclusion. whenever you see 2 -ve sentence, tick neither follows.

### Trick questions
---
- keep in mind that they can use antonym of the word in conclusion like how in the below example they used **uneducated** instead of **educated**. In these cases change the conclusion sent to original word. Here first conclusion can be changed to 
	- No worker is educated.
