### Ways to solve page rank
- Flow equation method
- Power iteration method
	- Transition matrix M is stochastic column matrix in normal case. For graph dead ends column sum of that node will be 0.

### Random Walk Interpretation
- [explanation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpiyOxiVmCg&t=9s)
- p(t) is vector of probability distribution over pages, where ith coordinate is the
prob. that the surfer is at page ùíä at time ùíï.
- if p(t+1) = p(t), p(t) is called stationary distribution.

### Google formulation
- [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSGQ4F1E6H8)
- under certain conditions page rank vector will  be unique. For page rank to converge it should not have - 
	- spider traps
	- dead ends
- Random teleport

### Markov Chains
- [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoYMFLvDnv0)
- Transition matrix M should be - 
	- stochastic
	- aperiodic
	- irreducible
### Topic sensitive page rank (Bias the random walk)
- teleport set
	- random walker will only teleport to these set of relevant pages instead of all the pages.

### How do we compute
- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUuRL_dIpr0)
- [how to store and compute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd6YWBZgNHI)
- We don't use Google Matrix A, because it is dense matrix and takes up lots of memory.
- So we recompute the equation and use M matrix with a little code to add the leaked age ranks

### Problems of Page rank
- Measures generic popularity of a page
	- Topic Specific page rank
- use only a single measure of importance
	- hubs and authorities
- susceptible to link spam
	- trust rank
