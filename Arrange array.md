### approach - 1
- Time Complexity
- space complexity

#### pseudo code

#### mistakes
- don't try to use two pointer like [[75-sort colors]] problem as it will mess up the order of the numbers
- don't use for loop in brute force approach as pos or neg array may be empty, use while loop instead
#### code snippet
```python

```
