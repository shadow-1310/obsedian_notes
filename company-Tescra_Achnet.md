#### Video resume

- intro
	- Hello Team Achnet, Shekhar here. I am currently in 2nd year of IIT Guwahati Mtech programme of Biomedical Engineering
	-  Although as for my personal projects I have worked in some of the technology. I am really interested to be involved in life cycle of a fully deployed software.And for this I think AchNet will give me the platform to learn and grow.
	- in my previous experience, I have worked as an deep learning engineer intern at Resolute Software. Where my day to day activities were involved in proof-of-concept projects provided by the clients along with completing self learning tasks to grow my skills. The projects were mainly around computer vision where I used the technologies like YOLO, OpenCV, Streamlit etc.
	- For my personal projects, I have worked in domains like price prediction using regression and tree based models, recommendation system using collaborative filtering and also computer vision models. 
	- Finally for my master thesis project, I have established benchmark of various dimensionality reduction methods in Machine learning.
	- As part of my assignments/ projects related to institute courses, I am currently developing recommendation system using hadoop and spark. also application of image segmentation in medical field.
	- I have also done some courses from coursera which are probs and stats for ML, structuring ML projects, data analysis with excel
- requirements
	- No DSA round,
		- technical test will consist of MCQ on OOP, DSA, Quant, Reasoning
	- must know NoSQL databases like redis, MongoDB for PI round
- ppt

## DSA
- [ ] [[Sorting]]
### OOPs MCQ
- [sanfoundry website 1000 mcq](https://www.sanfoundry.com/1000-object-oriented-programming-oops-questions-answers/)
- Constructor
	- special case on constructor with only one argument
	- copy costructor
		- Copy an object so that it can be passed to a function
- Destructor
	- What happens when an object is passed by reference?
		- The destructor is never called in this situation. The concept is that when an object is passed by reference to the function, the constructor is not called, but only the main object will be used. Hence no destructor will be called at end of function.
