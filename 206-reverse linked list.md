### approach - 1
- Time Complexity
- space complexity

#### pseudo code
- maintain two pointers `curr` and `prev`
- iterate through the linked list and change `curr.next](<http://curr.next>) = prev` but before that save curr.next in other variable and use this variable to chage curr
#### mistakes
- donâ€™t return the head as after the last loop it will become None
    - return the prev or tail
#### code snippet
```python
