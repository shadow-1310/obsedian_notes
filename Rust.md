### Learnings
- accessing a nth character of a String 
	- we can use the str.chars().nth(N) method, but it has O(N) complexity
	- we can use str.as_bytes()[n], this is O(N) time complexity, as suggested by [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71824249/get-value-of-nth-char-in-string-in-rust)
	- and finally we can convert the String to vector and then access its characters 
```rust
let chars: Vec<&char> = str.chars().collect()
```


## Daywise
---
#### Day1 - [[2024-01-06]]
- learnt shadowing
	- for unused variable compiler will through error
- error handling
	- expect
- Always trim values when taking inputs from user as it contains '\n'
- statements and expressions
	- statements does not have return value
	- expression have return value
	- at then last line of a block, don't add ';'
- functions
	- Â In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function.
- Loops
	- we can give name to loops

#### Day2 - [[2024-01-07]]
- Ownership and borrowing
	- String and String literals
		- String can be mutable and are of variable size
		- string literal is immutable and hardcoded at compile time
			- they are also fixed size
