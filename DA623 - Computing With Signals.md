## Syllabus
- Plenoptic Function
	- $P(\theta,\phi,\lambda)$ is
		- single view point
		- at a time
		- as function of wavelength
	- $P(\theta,\phi,\lambda, t)$ is
		- single view point
		- over time
		- as function of wavelength
	- $P(\theta,\phi,\lambda, t, V_x, V_y, V_z)$ is
		- any view point
		- over time
		- as function of wavelength
- Human eye mechanism
	- Cones 
		- operates in color vision
	- Rods
		- operates in greyscale vision
- How does camera capture color
	- Bayer filter
- Color Features
	- Luminance 
		- greyscale image is computed as average of RGB
		- luminance is calculated giving more weightage to green
	- YPrPb
		- JPG image coding
			- first JPG converts RGB into YPrPb, where 
				- Y -> luminance
				- Pr -> degree of redness
				- Pb -> degree of blueness
			- second, JPG downsamples Yr and Yb where they have half many rows and columns as Y
	- Chrominance
