## Syllabus
- Plenoptic Function
	- $P(\theta,\phi,\lambda)$ is
		- single view point
		- at a time
		- as function of wavelength
	- $P(\theta,\phi,\lambda, t)$ is
		- single view point
		- over time
		- as function of wavelength
	- $P(\theta,\phi,\lambda, t, V_x, V_y, V_z)$ is
		- any view point
		- over time
		- as function of wavelength
- Human eye mechanism
	- Cones 
		- operates in color vision
	- Rods
		- operates in greyscale vision
- How does camera capture color
	- Bayer filter
- Color Features
	- Luminance 
		- greyscale image is computed as average of RGB
		- luminance is calculated giving more weightage to green
	- YPrPb
		- JPG image coding
			- first JPG converts RGB into YPrPb, where 
				- Y -> luminance
				- Pr -> degree of redness
				- Pb -> degree of blueness
			- second, JPG downsamples Yr and Yb where they have half many rows and columns as Y
	- Chrominance
		- color shift of the image
- Use of color bar
- binary image
	- types 
		- hard threshold
		- random dithering 
		- floyd steinberg dithering
	- selecting a threshold
	- Properties
		- geometric properties
			- 0th Moment gives - area
			- 1st moment gives - centre of area
			- axis of least 2nd moment - orientation
		- segmenting binary images
			- region growth algorithm
				- find unlabeled seed point with b=1, if not found terminate
				- assign new label to point
				- assign same label to neighbor points with b = 1
				- assign same label to neighbor of neighbors with b = 1, repeat until no more points with b=1 is found
				- go to first step 
			- LSIS - Linear Shift Invariance Shift
		- Convolution
			- Properties
				- prove that convolution is LSIS
				- Commutative
				- Associative
				- Cascaded System
			- Problems
				- Border problem
				- Solution
					- ignore border
					- pad with constant value
					- pad with reflection
			- Examples
				- Impulse filter
				- image shift
				- averaging
			- Kernel/Filters
				- Linear
					- Gaussian
						- setting kernel size, $K=2*\pi*\sigma$, as $\sigma$ increases K increases
						- larger kernel more blurring
						- gaussian smoothing is separable
							- we can use two 1D kernels instead of one 2D kernel
					- problems
						- doesnot remove outliers
						- smooths edges (blur)
				- Non Linear
					- Median filter
						- sort the values in window centred at the pixel
						- assign the middle value to pixel
				- Template matching (lecture 18)
					- cross correlation
					- **problems**
					- solution
						- normalized cross correlation - account for energy differences
				- Edge detection
					- requirements
						- high detection rate
						- good localization
						- low noise sensitivity
					- first derivative provides location and strength of edge
					- Gradient represents direction of most rapid change in image intensity
					- Gradient Operators
						- Robert 
						- Prewitt
						- Sobel (3x3)
						- Sobel (5x5)
						- Smaller Kernel vs larger kernel
							- good localization | poor localization |
							- noise sensitive | less noise sensitive |
							- poor detection | good detection |
