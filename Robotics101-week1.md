## Assignment: 
Lane Detection and Tracking using OpenCV
## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to develop a lane detection and tracking system using OpenCV.


The code should include the following steps:
1. Convert the image to grayscale.
2. Apply the Canny edge detection algorithm to detect edges.
3. Define a region of interest (ROI) to focus on the lower part of the image.
4. Use the Hough transform to detect lines in the ROI or any other algorithm you can think of....if you do not know about Hough transform you can just google it.
5. Draw the detected lane lines on the original image.
